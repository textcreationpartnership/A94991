            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

BecauÅ¿e Enemies of this kinde may prove moÅ¿t dangerous if they be not diÅ¿covered and avoyded, it is at this time our duty to make Å¿uch Malignants known to the people that they be not deceived and drawn away from their own Å¿tedfaÅ¿tneÅ¿Å¿e, and from the love of ChriÅ¿t and of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren: But in doing this duty we have great need of wiÅ¿dome, and the Spirit of diÅ¿cerning, that we neither take our friends to be our enemies, and by that miÅ¿take diÅ¿courage the well affected and multiply enemies againÅ¿t our Å¿elves, nor Å¿uch as are indeed enemies to be our friends, and thereby wrong the cauÅ¿e of God and weaken our Å¿elves in Å¿eeking after Reformation: and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they muÅ¿t not be taken for enemies who hope the beÅ¿t of the Kings MajeÅ¿ty, and profes that they love his honour (which is the calumnie of the Malignant, againÅ¿t the Å¿eekers of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation) nor Å¿uch as in the begining through want of perÅ¿waÅ¿ion were not Å¿o forward for Reformation, nor Å¿uch as in debate

               </gap> under the falÅ¿e pretence of Loyalty to the Kings MajeÅ¿ty, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reÅ¿pect to religion or the good of religion, we ought in all our Speeches and Praiers to teÅ¿tifie our faithfullneÅ¿Å¿e and high reÅ¿pects to the Kings MajeÅ¿ty, and alÅ¿o to preÅ¿Å¿e and pray for the unity of religion, and for the proÅ¿pering all the good waies that may conduce for Å¿o bleÅ¿Å¿ed a worke, as Å¿erving for the honour of God, and for the King his greatneÅ¿Å¿e, and the true peace of his Kingdoms, declaring all Å¿uch as oppoÅ¿e the unity of Religion to be enemies to God, to the King, and to the peace and proÅ¿perity of the Kingdoms.</p>
            <p>Now Å¿ince it is incumbent to us by our calling, and commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us by the generall AÅ¿Å¿embly according to our calling, to uÅ¿e all lawfull and EccleÅ¿iaÅ¿tick waies for furtherance of refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation and unity of Religion, for continuance of our own peace at home, and of the common peace betwixt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, a neceÅ¿Å¿ity is laid upon us.</p>
            <p>FirÅ¿t, to give warning to the people of the danger of the ProteÅ¿tant religion, through the PopiÅ¿h Armies in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Jreland,</hi> pretending that they are better and more dutifull Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects then the ProteÅ¿tants, but intending no leÅ¿Å¿e then the ruine of the reformed Religion, and the planting of their HeriÅ¿ie, Idolatry, and Tyrannie in a more compendious way then could have bin, don by the late Service-booke, and Booke of Cannons in which courÅ¿e if they Å¿hall by their power prevaile, it Å¿hall be impoÅ¿Å¿ible for the Kings MajeÅ¿ty to Å¿uppreÅ¿Å¿e Popery, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine the true religion, conforme to the many promiÅ¿es con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teined in his MajeÅ¿ties Declarations; They will Å¿oone caÅ¿t off their profeÅ¿Å¿ed Allegiance and Å¿ubjection, and it will be no eaÅ¿ie matter for this Church and Kingdome, whence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all their troubles and diÅ¿appointments to have iÅ¿Å¿ued to reÅ¿iÅ¿t that violence, eÅ¿pecially conÅ¿idering what a diÅ¿affected and diÅ¿contented party we have at home in our own boÅ¿om.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Å¿ince unity in the truth hath bin our Å¿trength Å¿ince the begining, we ought by all good meanes in publick and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate, to prevent and remove all diviÅ¿ive motions which by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious and crafty Å¿ichophants are endeavoured by Å¿preading of Calumnies and IÅ¿landers againÅ¿t the preÅ¿ent Government, and putting aÅ¿perÅ¿ions on Å¿uch, whether of the Nobillity &amp; Gentry,

            <p>Thirdly, that Å¿ince by the providence of God the two King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes are Å¿o Å¿trongly united, and there be hopes of a more Å¿trong union by unity of religion. It is our duty to labour to remove and prevent all occaÅ¿ions of jealouÅ¿ies and Å¿uÅ¿pitions betwixt the two Kingdomes, and to do or Å¿ay nothing that may breed miÅ¿underÅ¿tandings, breake off correÅ¿pondence, weaken the confidence or infringe the Union and Peace betwixt the two Kingdomes, Å¿o happily eÅ¿tabliÅ¿hed in his MajeÅ¿ties preÅ¿ence and with his royall conÅ¿ent in both Parliaments.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, becauÅ¿e when we Å¿peake for the Kings honour and for obedience to civill Authority in all things lawfull, our Å¿peeches are wreÅ¿ted by perverÅ¿e men to their corrupt ends, as if we loved not the reformation of religion in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;</hi> and when we Å¿peake of reformation, we are traduced as enemies to the King and to royall Authority, which may make a great miÅ¿taking and worke dangerous effects amongÅ¿t the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who love both reformation of religion and the Kings ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: Therefore in this difficulty we ought to Å¿hew in our Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, that there is no repugnancy, betwixt the Kings Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the reformation of religion, that nothing can Å¿erve Å¿o much for his MajeÅ¿ties glory and the greatneÅ¿Å¿e of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, as doth the reformation of religion in all his dominions, and that Å¿uch as are oppoÅ¿ite to the reformation, are greateÅ¿t enemies to the Kings honour, whatÅ¿oever they profeÅ¿Å¿e or Å¿weare to the contrary, and alÅ¿o to explaine the difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Kings power and juÅ¿t authority, and the pretending and abuÅ¿ing thereof by Å¿uch men for their own private ends; and to Å¿hew that oppoiÅ¿iition to Å¿uch men and their waies, is a true teÅ¿timony of faithfullneÅ¿Å¿e and loyalty to the King.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the PreÅ¿biteries be carefull to diÅ¿cern and try theÅ¿e Malignants and to reclaime or cenÅ¿ure them according to the Acts of the AÅ¿Å¿em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and to make report of their dilligence to the next AÅ¿Å¿embly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In end, becauÅ¿e much every way doth depend upon us of the MiniÅ¿try, we have need to Å¿tir up our Å¿elves and the people in truth and unity, which by the bleÅ¿Å¿ing of God will be a powre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full

We find it neceÅ¿Å¿ary that there Å¿hall be a Å¿olemn faÅ¿t and humiliation kept in all the Kirkes of this Kingdom upon the third Sunday of <hi>February</hi> next, and the <hi>ThurÅ¿day</hi> following, for the cauÅ¿es add motives following.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Although within theÅ¿e few Yeares wee renewed the Covenant and Vowed Å¿olemnely to Å¿tand to the former reformation of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to reforme our Å¿elves and our Families We have notwitÅ¿tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding fallen from the zeale and fervency of our affection at that time, many perÅ¿ons of all ranks and callings are growne luke-warm and are content with a meer formality and Å¿hew of godlines, without inward power yea Å¿ins and vices abound as in the time of corruption, Family <hi>worÅ¿hip,</hi> mutual edification &amp; Å¿tirring up on of another by information admonition, conÅ¿olation rebuke much neglected &amp; <hi>MiniÅ¿ters</hi> negligent in urging the Å¿ame all which are Å¿o much the more heynous becauÅ¿e of our unthankefullnes after Å¿o great mercies &amp; breach of Covenant.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The danger of this Church and Kingdome ariÅ¿ing partly from within; by the inÅ¿olency of PapiÅ¿ts in theÅ¿e troubleÅ¿ome times, and diviÅ¿ive motions of the Malignant Party, and creeping in if errors; and partly without, from the PopiÅ¿h Armies and Praelaticall party in <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> which aim undoubtedly at the diÅ¿turbance of our peace, and overthrow of the wiÅ¿h of Reformation: The conÅ¿ide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof Å¿hould move us to pray to God to dir ct us in all law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full meanes which may Å¿erve for unity amongÅ¿t our Å¿elves, that wee may be the more Å¿trengthened againÅ¿t the common enemy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In reÅ¿pect of the fellow feeling which we ought to have with the
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:158375:5"/> Members of ChriÅ¿ts body farre and neere, wee have cauÅ¿e to lament the long caÅ¿ting troubles of the Churches abroad in <hi>Germany,</hi> and elÅ¿e where, and eÅ¿pecially the combuÅ¿tions in <hi>England,</hi> and almoÅ¿t utter deÅ¿olation in <hi>Irela<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>â¢</desc>
                  </gap>d.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. That the Lord may bleÅ¿Å¿e all lawfull meanes to be uÅ¿ed for pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erving the union and peace betwixt the two Kingdomes, and procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the unity of Religion, and uniformitie of worÅ¿hip and Church Government within his MajeÅ¿ties Dominions eÅ¿pecially that God would grant a good Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e to the Treaty and travells of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿sioners both of the Parliament and generall aÅ¿Å¿embly.</p>
            <p n="5">5. BecauÅ¿e the unhappy diviÅ¿ion; betwixt the King and Parliament of <hi>England</hi> is a great impediment to the wiÅ¿h of Reformation, and the Å¿etling of a firm peace in his MajeÅ¿ties Dominions: It is our duty to recommend earneÅ¿tly to the <hi>Lord,</hi> that the differences may be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿ed in Å¿uch a way as may moÅ¿t conduce to the glory of God, and advance the Å¿o much wiÅ¿hed for unity of Religion and uniformity of Church Government.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Finally, that the Lord would diÅ¿cover and diÅ¿appoint all the conÅ¿piracies plots and machinations, which tend to the execution of the bloody decrees of the councel of <hi>Trent;</hi> the fountain from whence hath iÅ¿Å¿ued all the troubles and perÅ¿ecutions to the reformed Churches; and quickly deÅ¿troy that Man of Å¿in. <hi>Amen.</hi>
